Small adaptor/breakout board UART to RS232, with RJ-45 connector

It is based on the popular MAX3232 device, able to work with VCC supply voltage between 3.3V and 5.5V. It is compatible with both 3.3V CMOS and 5V TTL signal levels from the UART side. Several options for compatible parts have been listed in the schematic file.

This adaptor can work with most of the microcontrollers (including Arduino) and Rasperry-Pi-like boards with UART interface, allowing the direct connection to the Auxiliary Console port of a Router/Access-Point with Cisco Console Auxiliary pinout.


Full documentation is available, including schematic, layout, Gerber files, centroid positioning files and Bill-Of-Materials. It will be possible to order fully-assembled PCBs from any PCB supplier.
